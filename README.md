# fantasy-draft-calculator
This is a simple fantasy football draft calculator program, plus the front end website for the program, used at freefantasycalculator.com .

The program calculates how much you should pay for a player in a fantasy football auction draft, or the order that you should pick players in a snake draft, based on projections of player stats for the season.

The program is written in Python and the website in basic HTML/CSS.
