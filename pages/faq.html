    	<li id="q1"><h6><a href=# class="faq_link">How do I use the Free Fantasy Calculator?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">The FFC is very easy to use - just put your league settings (point values, the number of teams in the league, etc.) and click "Submit". You'll get a list of players back which tells you how much you should pay for each player, listed from most valuable to least valuable, or if you are in a regular non-auction (snake) draft the order in which you should draft players. Of course, this list will just be a starting point, and the order you draft players will be affected by who you have already drafted and what the other players in your draft do, e.g., if you've already taken a kicker you don't need to take another one even if the most valuable player on the board is a kicker. On the other hand, if you've already filled all of your RB slots it still may be a good move to draft another RB if they are so valuable that you could get more value for your team through a trade later. Additionally, if no one in your draft is going to pay over $5 for a defense (or draft a defense in the first 10 rounds), then you don't need to either - instead, you can pay less for a defense (or draft one later), bank that extra value, and use the extra dollars or earlier draft positions on other players that might be more coveted by your opponents.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q2"><h6><a href="#q1" class="faq_link">What is the methodology behind your calculations?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">We calculate a player's value based on the projected fantasy points they will accrue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player">above and beyond a "replacement level" player</a> at their position. Replacement level is defined as the player with the most expected fantasy points that will go undrafted at that position. Given the number of dollars available in your league, the number of players that need to be drafted, and the given player projections we calculate how much each player is worth according to how many fantasy points they will give you above the replacement level player, what proportion of the total points above replacement that accounts for and the total number of dollars chasing those points. There are a few assumptions made in the calculations (e.g. what proportion of bench spots go to each position, what proportion of your payroll goes to starters vs. bench players, etc.) but most do not actually affect the outcome much either way. Additionally, we adjust the draft values from what the stat projections would say on their own due to the relative inability of projections to predict performance at certain positions (kickers in particular, and to a lesser extent defenses - WRs and TEs also receive minor adjustments).</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q3"><h6><a href="#q2" class="faq_link">Where did you get the projections?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">We used consensus projections from <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php?week=draft">Fantasy Pros</a>, which combines projections from CBS Sports, ESPN, numberFire and FFToday into one aggregate, averaged projection. For Defense / Special Teams projections we used CBS Sports alone, as all the sources above don't publish projections for defense.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q4"><h6><a href="#q3" class="faq_link">How do I use this for a regular, non-auction draft?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">Just draft players in the order that they are ranked in the output, and ignore the dollar values assigned to each player. This will account for the strength of each player and the scarcity at each position. However, you should realize that your draft strategy should depend on what the other players in your draft do. If everyone in your draft had this same information then you should just draft in this order, but if everyone else is less informed (which is often the case) then you may forgo a higher ranked but undervalued player (by others) because you believe they will still be available later in the draft.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q5"><h6><a href="#q4" class="faq_link">Why is "Player X" ranked above "Player Y" when "Player Y" has more projected fantasy points?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">This is because "Player X" is at a position that is less productive in terms of fantasy points, so the value that he has above a player that you could pick up from the free agent pool is greater. An example: in many leagues Jamaal Charles will be the most valuable projected player and Peyton Manning will be somewhere down the list despite the fact that Manning is expected to produce more fantasy points. This is because any random QB that you pick up out of the free agent pool (say, a Carson Palmer or Andy Dalton type) will still produce a lot of points while a RB that you pick up out of the pool (say, Mark Ingram or Jacquizz Rodgers) won't produce half as many points. So, if you can draft a RB to fill a spot that is much more valuable than a replacement level RB you could pick up later, then you should do so.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q6"><h6><a href="#q5" class="faq_link">What does a negative dollar value mean?</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">Basically, it means that you shouldn't draft that player (according to the projections we use as input). More precisely, it means that this player is below "replacement level", and the size of the negative number is how far below "replacement level" that player is. Again, "replacement level" is the most valuable player that should go undrafted at that position - so if a player has a negative dollar value then they are less valuable (are projected to produce fewer points) than that replacement level player.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="q7"><h6><a href="#q6" class="faq_link">The tool isn't working for me - I'm getting an error or weird output.</a></h6>
        	<p class="hidden">Make sure you are only putting numbers into the input boxes and that there aren't any weird values (negative numbers, decimals where there should be integers, etc). If you are still having trouble let us know with an <a href="mailto:contact@freefantasycalculator.com">email</a></p>
